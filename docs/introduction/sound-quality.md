# Sound Quality

Assessing the sound quality of AirPods replicas can help you determine their performance relative to the original AirPods.

## Sound Quality Rating

The best widely available AirPods 2, AirPods 3, AirPods 4, AirPods Pro, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3 replicas score about 8-9/10 in sound quality when compared to the original AirPods.

::: details Do AirPods Pro sound better than AirPods 4?
Since AirPods Pro seal into the ear, they may sound significantly better than AirPods 2/3, which are shaped to let outside noise in. It is recommended to choose the shape and fit that is preferred.
