# Sound Quality

Assessing the sound quality of AirPods replicas can help you determine their performance relative to the original AirPods.

## Sound Quality Rating

The best widely available AirPods 2, AirPods 3, AirPods 4, AirPods Pro and Pro 2 replicas score about 8-9/10 in sound quality when compared to the original AirPods.

::: details Do AirPods Pro sound better than AirPods 4?
Since AirPods Pro seal into the ear, they may sound significantly better than AirPods 2/3, which are shaped to let outside noise in. However, the AirPods 2/3 clones do sound closer to the original than the AirPods Pro clones at this point. It is recommended to choose the shape and fit that is preferred.

## Sound Quality Variations

Sound quality can vary depending on the version, chip, and batch. Many models emphasize bass without being overpowering. Mids are pronounced, but highs could be improved. Note that the EQ can vary by seller, and you can adjust it using your music player's settings.

::: tip
The EQ can vary by seller. Use **FlyCC**, **BullSuper**, or **Starfun** to adjust it for **TigerBuilder**, **HR**, and **Huilian** devices respectively.
