# Features

AirPods replicas offer a variety of features that mimic those of the original AirPods.

## Supported Features

All current models of AirPods replicas support name changing, GPS, and changing tap controls (iOS and macOS only). Some models also support Spatial Audio, Audio Share, and Live Listen (all iOS and macOS only). Certain AirPods Pro models support transparency mode, and newer models support Active Noise Cancelling (ANC). However, the ANC on these replicas may not be entirely as effective as on the original AirPods and might require time to perfect.

::: details Can the settings be changed using an Android device?
If you use Android, you can make all your touch settings changes on an iPhone at [https://airreps.info/iossettings](https://airreps.info/iossettings). These changes should carry over to your Android, although sometimes this doesn't work. Some manufacturers also have [their own Android apps](https://airpodsreplicas.com/useful-apps) that makes it possible to change these settings and more on Android devices.

## In-Ear Sensors

The in-ear sensors on the replicas pause the music almost instantly (around 1 second delay*) when removed from the ears. The "beep" sound when inserting the AirPods is a close imitation rather than the exact Apple sound. Only HR and Huilian models feature near identical sound effects, while other models or batches use a good quality copy that doesn't differ much from the original, though its quality may be lower on some models or batches.

## Tap and Force Touch Controls

The tap controls or Force Touch controls on the replicas are functional but might take some getting used to. For 2nd generation replicas, a firm tap is required, not a soft touch like on original AirPods. For Pro models, only a light push or squeeze is needed, not a touch.
:::info **Fun Fact**
5.3TB are the first and only AirReps to feature a force sensor configuration that closely matches the originals, providing the same experience at a much lower cost.

## Microphone Quality

The microphone quality on the replicas is usable and is very comparable to that on the original AirPods. They are good enough for calls, but like the Apple AirPods is not anything impressive due to their small form factor.

::: tip
The latest AirPods Pro 2 replicas (5.3 Huilian, HR & TB) have microphone quality comparable to the original AirPods.
