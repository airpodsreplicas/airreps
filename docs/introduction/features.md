# Features

AirPods replicas offer a variety of features that mimic those of the original AirPods.

## Supported Features

All current models of AirPods replicas support name changing, GPS, and changing tap controls (iOS and macOS only). Many models also support Spatial Audio, Audio Share, and Live Listen (all iOS and macOS only). Transparency mode and Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) are available on AirPods Pro, AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, AirPods 4, and AirPods Max models. The ANC on these replicas is really close to the original AirPods as shown in many reviews, but is not 1:1.

Newer models feature additional capabilities:
- **USB-C charging** (AirPods Pro 2 V5.1+, AirPods Pro 3, AirPods 4, AirPods Max V3)
- **iCloud Connect** (AirPods Pro 2 V5.4, AirPods Pro 3 V6, AirPods 4 V3)
- **Adaptive Audio** (AirPods Pro 2 V5.3+)
- **Conversation Awareness** (AirPods Pro 2 V5.3+)
- **Live Translation** (AirPods Pro 3 V6)

::: details Can the settings be changed using an Android device?
If you use Android, you can make all your touch settings changes on an iPhone at [https://airreps.info/iossettings](https://airreps.info/iossettings). These changes should carry over to your Android, although sometimes this doesn't work. Some manufacturers also have [their own Android apps](https://airpodsreplicas.com/useful-apps) that makes it possible to change these settings and more on Android devices.

## In-Ear Sensors

The in-ear sensors on the replicas pause the music almost instantly (around 1 second delay*) when removed from the ears. The "beep" sound when inserting the AirPods closely matches the original Apple sound on most current models.

## Tap and Force Touch Controls

The tap controls or Force Touch controls on the replicas are functional but might take some getting used to. For 2nd generation replicas, a firm tap is required, not a soft touch like on original AirPods. For Pro models, only a light push or squeeze is needed, not a touch.
:::info **Fun Fact**
AirPods Pro 2 replicas (V5.3TB and newer) feature a force sensor configuration that closely matches the originals, providing the same experience at a much lower cost.
:::
## Microphone Quality

The microphone quality on the replicas is usable and is very comparable to that on the original AirPods. They are good enough for calls, but like Apple AirPods, they are not anything impressive due to their small form factor.

::: tip
The latest AirPods Pro 2 replicas (V5.4 and V5.3 Huilian, HR & TB) have microphone quality comparable to the original AirPods.
