# Build Quality

Understanding the build quality of AirPods replicas can help you evaluate their overall durability and authenticity.

## Weight

The case and pods generally have a good weight to them. Most models match the accurate weight of the original AirPods.

## Hinge

Some models use a plastic hinge with metallic paint, while others employ a real metal hinge. Some plastic hinges may feel cheap, squeak, move, and lack solidity. While usable, they are noticeable compared to the original AirPods. Metal hinges feel significantly superior.
It is important to know that all replicas sold in AirReps have metal hinges. Some units (such as Huilian and HR<b>+</b>) use a near‑perfect copy of the Apple hinge. As of now, HR+ does have some alignment issues, so the price difference might not be justified.

## Text

The "Designed by Apple" text on the back uses a font similar to the original. The text inside the case and earbuds looks alike but does not match the original AirPods exactly. Some batches have real serial numbers, while others do not. The text alignment and color can vary, sometimes it's not perfectly straight or may be a lighter or darker grey compared to the originals. The quality of the "Designed by Apple" text differs by seller, with Hicity's laser engraving being less accurate than Earhive's and Jenny's.
:::tip
You can request custom laser engraving by sending your preferred seller a WhatsApp message with the text you want engraved along with your order number. For more specialized requests like logos or detailed designs you can send your favorite artwork in .svg or .png format to Jenny or Earhive. Regular text and emojis don’t require these file formats.

## Back Button

The back button is flush with the case, but on some models, it clicks louder than the original and doesn't feel as smooth. Some batches feature a more pronounced button.

## Lid and Magnets

All the latest models have reverse magnets, ensuring the lid stays open when needed.

## LED Diffuser

Newer models include an LED diffuser to dim the LED.

## Ear Tips (AirPods Pro Replicas)

For AirPods Pro replicas, avoid forcibly removing the ear tips as it could damage the pods. To remove the ear tips, twist and pull them off. When handling the pods, hold them by the tip and not by the stem to prevent damage. You may use the /eartip command in the Discord server to learn more.

::: warning
For AirPods Pro replicas, handle the pods carefully to avoid damage. Do not forcibly remove the ear tips.

## FAQ

::: details Can fake AirPods be charged in a real case or vice versa?
No, fake AirPods should not be charged in a real case. Doing so may cause the fake AirPods to break soon after. It is also not recommended to charge real AirPods in a fake case.
:::

::: details Will AirPods cases fit on clones?
All soft silicone protective cases will fit, but hard plastic cases may not fit most clones (mostly older models as they are slightly bigger than the originals). Some hard cases may fit, but may not come off or affect the button if it sticks out slightly.
