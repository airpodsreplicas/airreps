# Dictionary

## W2C: Where To Cop/Where To Buy

"W2C" means "Where can I buy this item?" Used when seeking the source or seller of a product.

**Example:** "Can you put the W2C for the V5.3's in the subreddit?"

## Reps/Clones: Replicas

"Reps" or "Clones" refer to product imitations designed to copy a particular product (in this case, AirPods) as precisely as possible. This is distinct from a 'knockoff'.

**Example:** "Where can I get the best AirPods reps/clones?"

## Fake AirPods

"Fake AirPods" is an informal term for AirPods replicas or clones. In this guide, we use "replicas" or "clones" to describe higher-quality third-party products that aim to match Apple features at a lower price.

## Knockoffs

"Knockoffs" refer to products designed to resemble popular brands while avoiding intellectual property infringement (e.g., "Gucce" instead of "Gucci").

## GP: Guinea Pig

"Guinea Pigging" means being the first person to order and review a seller's product, allowing the community to evaluate its quality.

**Example:** "Is anyone willing to GP Troy's V4's?"

## QC: Quality Control [PICS]

"QC" stands for Quality Control. "QC PICS" refers to pictures used to verify the quality of a purchased product.

**Example:** "Can you send me the QC pics for HiCity v2.5's?"

## LC: Legit Check

A "Legit Check" verifies the authenticity of a product, often used when purchasing from non-retail sources like eBay or Facebook Marketplace.

**Example:** "Can someone LC these AirPods Pros for me?"

## Agent: Freight Agent/Shipping Forwarder

An "Agent" is a third party who facilitates safe purchases from sellers (often in China) to buyers. They act as representatives, ensuring products are not faulty and buyers receive what they ordered. We recommend [OOPBuy](https://airreps.link/oopbuy).

**Example:** "You might need to use an agent to get them, as currently HiCity doesn't ship to the Philippines."

## Markings: Product Labeling

"Markings" refer to the text on the case and AirPods that provide information about the product, including "Designed by Apple in California" text, model numbers, and serial numbers.
