# Battery Life

Understanding the battery life of AirPods replicas can help you manage your expectations and use them effectively.

## Average Battery Life

The average battery life of AirPods replicas is around 8-10 hours per charge at 75% volume. The case can provide 2-3 full charges for the earbuds, giving you a total usage time of 24-30 hours. Older models typically achieved 5-7 hours per charge, while some high-end models like the Pro 2 V5.3 TB average around 7-8 hours.

::: tip
Current replica models generally offer 8-10 hours of battery life, though performance can vary between batches and manufacturing quality.

## Battery Life Variations

The actual battery life may vary depending on the model version, chip generation, manufacturing batch, and usage patterns. Factors like volume level, features used, and the age of the replica can all impact performance.

## Battery Level Accuracy

The battery levels on iOS devices may not always be accurate, though this issue has been largely resolved in newer replicas. However, just like original AirPods, the replicas will beep when the battery reaches 20%. On Android devices, battery levels can be checked in Bluetooth settings or using apps like TWTools, Materialpods, or Andropods for more accurate readings.

::: warning
Battery level readings on iOS devices may not always be accurate. Android users can use specific apps for more precise monitoring.

## Wireless/Fast Charging

AirReps support both wireless and wired fast charging, but older models can overheat or even get damaged if left on the charger for too long, especially when using wireless charging. To stay safe, avoid charging for more than 2–3 hours at a time, and unplug them if the case starts to feel warm.

Newer models like **5.3TB**, **5.3HR+**, and **5.4Huilian** handle fast charging much better and are safe to use with both wired and wireless chargers.

::: danger
Extended wireless charging or fast charging may cause overheating in some models, particularly older versions. Always monitor temperature during wireless charging.
