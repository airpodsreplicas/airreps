# Connectivity

Understanding the connectivity of AirPods replicas can help you make an informed purchasing decision.

## iOS Popup

The iOS popup appears almost instantly on some AirPods replicas, although the speed may vary based on the seller and batch. In some cases, the popup may appear faster than on original AirPods.

## macOS Connectivity

  Only a few newer clones work flawlessly with macOS, whereas this is not always case with other manufacturers. We recommend choosing the "Huilian" model if you plan on using your replicas with your MacBook or iMac. This is due to other clones not having iCloud switching for seamless iOS integration, or/and having their volume stuck at 100% on macOS (TB/HR/HR+). However, weâ€™ve partially addressed the volume issue by using the **BackgroundMusic** app to adjust volume manually. The only caveat is that on TB/HR/HR+ models, the volume gestures on the AirPods will not work due to the limitations of said app. For more details, visit [our troubleshooting guide](https://airpodsreplicas.com/troubleshooting/MacOS-volume-adjustment-bug).

## Range

The range of most AirPods replicas matches that of the original AirPods, around 10 meters. However, obstructions like thick walls can affect this range.

## Latency

Some AirPods replicas may have better latency than original AirPods, resulting in improved audio-video synchronization. Websites like YouTube automatically adjust for latency.

## Multi-Device Connectivity

Currently, most replicas support connecting to multiple devices at once. But only Huilian models can connect to several Apple devices using iCloud Connect.

::: warning
Multi-device connectivity via iCloud Connect is only supported on 5.3 and 5.4 Huilian models. All others lack this feature.

## Initial Connectivity with iOS Devices

In some cases, AirPods replicas may not connect to iOS devices initially. However, a fix often exists for this issue. Please refer to the Troubleshooting section for more information.
