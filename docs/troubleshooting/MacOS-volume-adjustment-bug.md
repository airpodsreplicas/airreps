# **MacOS volume Adjustment Bug**
The volume control issue occurs because AirPods replicas don’t always fully support Apple’s Bluetooth and iCloud systems. Unlike real AirPods, these clones use cheaper Bluetooth chips that don’t work perfectly with macOS or iOS devices. As a result, the volume control function often doesn’t work as expected. Though by adjusting some settings, you can work around this bug and get volume control back.

**PS: This bug isn't present on clones that use the Huilian chipset.**

## **Step 1**: Open **Audio MIDI Setup**

Click on the Finder logo in the left corner of your dock.
Open the **"Others"** folder

Find and click on **Audio MIDI Setup**.

## **Step 2**: Select Your **AirReps**

In the Audio MIDI Setup window, you’ll see a list of audio devices on the left.

Find and click on your **AirReps** in the list of available audio devices.

## **Step 3**: Change Output Channel

Under the Format section (on the right side of the window), you will see a drop-down menu for the sample rate.

By default, it may be set to 32kHz or higher.

Change the output channel from 32kHz to **16kHz**. This reduces the audio quality slightly but allows you to control the volume.

## **Step 4**: Test the Volume Control

Close the Audio MIDI Setup window.

Try adjusting the volume using the volume keys on your Mac or through the Sound settings in the menu bar.

You should now be able to control the volume properly, although audio quality might be a bit reduced.
