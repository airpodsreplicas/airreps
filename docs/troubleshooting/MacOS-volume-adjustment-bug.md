# **macOS Volume Adjustment Bug**

If you're using your AirReps on macOS, you may notice that volume control doesn’t work through the system’s native controls. This happens because most replica AirPods don’t fully integrate with macOS.
To regain control, you can use **Background Music**, a **free** and **open‑source** app that lets you adjust volume for individual apps. The only downside is that the volume gestures on the earbuds won’t work, as the native macOS volume control functionality is unavailable.

**PS: This bug isn't present on clones that use the Huilian chipset.**

## **Step 1: Download Background Music**

1. **Visit the GitHub Release Page:**
   Go to the official release page for *Background Music* on GitHub:

2. **Download the `.pkg` Installer:**
   On the release page, find the **BackgroundMusic-x.x.x.pkg** file. Click the link to download the `.pkg` file to your Mac.

## **Step 2: Install Background Music**

1. After the download is complete, locate the **BackgroundMusic-x.x.x.pkg** file in your **Downloads** folder.

2. Double-click the `.pkg` file to begin the installation.

3. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**

4. **Finish the Installation:**

## **Step 3: Launch Background Music**

1. **Open Background Music:**
   Once installed, you can find **Background Music** by searching for it in Spotlight or in your **Applications** folder.

## **Step 4: Adjust the Volume**

**Adjust App-Specific Volumes:**

Click the Background Music icon in the menu bar.

You will see a list of all running applications with audio output. Adjust the volume slider for the app that's playing audio, such as your music or video player.
