# **Airreps Incompatibility with iCloud Connect**
One common issue with some AirPods replicas is their compatibility with macOS. This issue is caused by the replicas' inability to fully support iCloud, resulting in iCloud verification failure. This issue can be easily fixed following the instructions below.

**PS: This bug isn't present on clones that use the Huilian chipset.**

## **Step 1**: Forget AirPods from iCloud Devices

On your **iPhone/iPad** (or any device connected to iCloud), go to **Settings > Bluetooth**.

Find your **AirPods Pro** in the list, tap the “i” icon, and select Forget This Device.

Do this on any other connected Apple devices (iPad, Apple Watch, etc.)

## **Step 2**: Forget **AirPods** from **macOS**

On **macOS**, open System Preferences > Bluetooth.

Find your AirPods Pro in the list, right-click, and select Remove.

## **Step 3**: **Reset** Your AirPods Pro Replicas

Place your AirPods in the charging case and open the lid.

Press and hold the pairing button on the back for 15 seconds until the light flashes amber and then white then close the case.

## **Step 4**: Re-pair AirPods with **macOS**

Open the AirPods case and make sure the white light is flashing.

On macOS, go to **System Preferences > Bluetooth** and select Connect next to your AirPods.
