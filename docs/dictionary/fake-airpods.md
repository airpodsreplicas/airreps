# Fake AirPods

“Fake AirPods” is a commonly used informal term for AirPods replicas or AirPods clones. In this guide, we usually say “replicas” or “clones” because they better describe higher‑quality third‑party products that aim to match Apple features at a lower price.

Fake AirPods vary widely by chip, firmware, and build quality. Our community tracks major versions and helps buyers avoid low‑tier knockoffs. If you’re new, start with the version summaries below, then use the buying links hub.

## FAQ

:::: details How to tell if your AirPods are fake?
Quick checks you can do in under a minute:

1) iOS “About” section: Connect to an iPhone → Settings → General → About → look for an “AirPods” entry. Verify the serial matches inside the lid. If missing or mismatched, they’re likely replicas. See our quick guide: [About section check](/version-info/general#faq).

2) Features present/missing: Compare capabilities (Spatial Audio, head‑tracking, iCloud Connect, Find My Network) with the relevant model in [Version Info](/version-info/general). Replicas typically miss “Find My Network.”

3) Build details and packaging: Minor tells include hinge feel, vent cutouts, text alignment, and packaging. Review our [Packaging guide](/introduction/packaging) and [QC/LC checklist](/ordering/qc-lc).

If unsure, post photos in our [Discord](/links/info#discord) for community QC.
