**Please note** that the following models are **discontinued**:

- **V1.6**

## V2 & V2.5 Version Differences:

**V2 TB**: The V2 model delivers satisfactory sound quality with support for EQ adjustments. It features a firmer shell and offers future-proofing through firmware update capability.

**V2.5**: This upgraded version provides enhanced Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and improved transparency mode. It also features a superior headband design compared to the V2. While advertised as supporting firmware updates, no updates have been released for this model as of yet (for the Bluetrum 893x version); 
Realtek 8763ESE does support OTA. 

## V3 Overview

Whilst advertised as V3, this model uses the same chip as the V2, and is compared to V1.5 by sellers, implying an almost non existential upgrade. As for now, the metal version hasn't come out yet, so the V3P can be regarded as a re-release of the V2 Plastic.
As for the V3 Metal version, it is an upgrade compared to the V2/V3P. This section will be updated with the main differences as units ship.
