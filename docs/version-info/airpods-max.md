**Please note** that the following models are **discontinued**:

- **V1.6**

## V2 & V2.5 Version Differences:

**V2 TB**: The V2 model delivers satisfactory sound quality with support for EQ adjustments. It features a firmer shell and offers future-proofing through firmware update capability.

**V2.5**: This upgraded version provides enhanced Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and improved transparency mode. It also features a superior headband design compared to the V2. While advertised as supporting firmware updates, no updates have been released for this model as of yet (for the Bluetrum 893x version); 
Realtek 8763ESE does support OTA. 

## V3 Overview

V3 is a significant upgrade from V2.5, featuring a different chipset (Airoha 1562AE) and improved features including upgraded Hybrid ANC, Spatial Audio with Head Tracking, and metal construction options. The V3 Metal version offers plush metal ear cups and headband, while the V3P version uses plastic construction.
