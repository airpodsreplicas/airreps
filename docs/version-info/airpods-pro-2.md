## V5.4 Version Differences:

This version is only an upgrade for Huilian models; it has a few improvements. ANC performance has been improved, and stability seems to be better. Hardware‑wise, nothing has really changed, apart from the chipset. These upgrades appear to be more of some firmware updates that will be restricted to this new unit.  


## V5.3 Version Differences:

**TB** - The TB earbuds are known for their white, tougher case that is more sweatproof than the HR model. They also feature an ST gyroscope, similar to the V4.7 and retail versions, which provides excellent spatial audio. The battery life of the TB model is 8 hours without ANC and 6 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. TB have the best ANC among the 5.3 (average 34.5 dB, peak 41 dB)

**HR** - The HR earbuds have a yellowish, softer case that is less sweatproof than the TB model. The battery life of the HR model is 7.5 hours without ANC and 5.5 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be balanced with a slight emphasis on bass. HR also has the best transparency. ANC is second to TB due to the older 1562AE chipset (34.4 dB, peak 39 dB)

**HR+** - Built on top of HR earbuds with an upgraded case, 1:1 hinge and sealed/glued (best workmanship). Also comes with one of the better mic qualities (isolated mic design). ANC is second to TB due to the older 1562AE chipset (34.5 dB, peak 40 dB)

**Huilian** - The Huilian earbuds use a middle‑of‑the‑pack case, firmer than HR but softer than TB, and are equipped with a 1:1 hinge. However, due to the Huilian chipset, ANC is significantly worse than the other two models — 5.3TB and 5.3HR (average 30–32 dB, peak 38 dB). The battery life of the Huilian model is 6 hours without ANC and 4.5 hours with ANC turned on.


## V5.2 Version Differences:

**TB** - The TB earbuds are known for their white, tougher case that is more sweatproof than the HR model. They also feature an ST gyroscope, similar to the V4.7 and retail versions, which provides excellent spatial audio. The battery life of the TB model is 8 hours without ANC and 6 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. TB have significantly better ANC than Huilian (average 33.6 dB, peak 39 dB).

**HR** - The HR earbuds have a yellowish, softer case that is less sweatproof than the TB model. The battery life of the HR model is 7 hours without ANC and 5 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. HR also has the best transparency and ANC performance (average 34.2 dB, peak 39 dB), although it is similar to TB in most situations.

**Huilian** - The Huilian earbuds use a middle‑of‑the‑pack case, firmer than HR but softer than TB, and are equipped with a 1:1 hinge. However, due to the Huilian chipset, ANC is significantly worse than the other two models — 5.2TB and 5.2HR (average 30–32 dB, peak 38 dB). The battery life of the Huilian model is 6 hours without ANC and 4.5 hours with ANC turned on.


## Version 5.3TB vs Version 5.2TB: Is the Upgrade Justified?

- The speaker has been upgraded from F10.2 to F11, though the change is relatively minor.
- The battery has been updated, but without any increase in capacity.
- The device now supports connection to up to three devices simultaneously.
- Adaptive ANC functionality has been improved, but the performance gain is marginal, estimated at only a 5% improvement over Version 5.2.

**Please note** that the following models are **discontinued**:

- **V5.2 Huilian**
- **V5.1 Huilian**
- **V5 Huilian**
