##V5.4 Version Differences:

This version is only an upgrade for HuiLian models, it has some few improvements. ANC performance has been improved, and the stability seems to be better. Hardware wise, nothing has really seemed to change, appart from the chipset. These upgrades look to be more of some firmware upgrades, that will be restricted to this new unit.  


## V5.3 Version Differences:

**TB** - The TB earbuds is known for its white, tougher case that is more sweatproof than the HR model. It also features a ST gyroscope, similar to the V4.7 and Retail versions, which provides excellent spatial audio. The battery life of the TB model is 8 hours without ANC, and 6 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. TB have the best ANC among the 5.3 (average 34.5db, peak 41db)

**HR** - The HR earbuds has a yellowish, softer case that is less sweatproof than the TB model.  The battery life of the HR model is 7.5 hours without ANC, and 5.5 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be balanced but slightly emphasis on bass. HR also has the best transparency. ANC is second to TB due to using of older chipset - 1562AE(34.4db, peak 39db)

**HR+** - Built on  top of HR earbuds with upgraded case, 1:1 hinge and sealed/glued (best worksmanship) - also come with one of the better mic quality (isolated mic design). ANC is second to TB due to using of older chipset - 1562AE(34.5db, peak 40db)

**Huilian** - The Huilian earbuds is the middle of the pack case, firmer than HR but softer than TB and equiped with 1:1 hinge. However due to Huilian chipset, ANC is significantly worse than the other two model - 5.3TB & 5.3HR (average 30-32 DB, peak 38db). The battery life of the Huilian model is 6 hours without ANC, and 4.5 hours with ANC turned on.


## V5.2 Version Differences:

**TB** - The TB earbuds is known for its white, tougher case that is more sweatproof than the HR model. It also features a ST gyroscope, similar to the V4.7 and Retail versions, which provides excellent spatial audio. The battery life of the TB model is 8 hours without ANC, and 6 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. TB have significant better ANC over Huilian (average 33.6db, peak 39db).

**HR** - The HR earbuds has a yellowish, softer case that is less sweatproof than the TB model.  The battery life of the HR model is 7 hours without ANC, and 5 hours with ANC turned on. Tuned to be bass heavy. HR also has the best transparency & ANC performance (average 34.2db, peak 39db), although it is similar to TB in most situations. 

**Huilian** - The Huilian earbuds is the middle of the pack case, firmer than HR but softer than TB and equiped with 1:1 hinge. However due to Huilian chipset, ANC is significantly worse than the other two model - 5.2TB & 5.2HR (average 30-32 DB, peak 38db). The battery life of the Huilian model is 6 hours without ANC, and 4.5 hours with ANC turned on.


## Version 5.3TB vs Version 5.2TB: Is the Upgrade Justified?

- The speaker has been upgraded from F10.2 to F11, though the change is relatively minor.
- The battery has been updated, but without any increase in capacity.
- The device now supports connection to up to three devices simultaneously.
- Adaptive ANC functionality has been improved, but the performance gain is marginal, estimated at only a 5% improvement over Version 5.2.

**Please note** that the following models are **discontinued**:

- **V5.2 Huilian**
- **V5.1 Huilian**
- **V5 Huilian**
