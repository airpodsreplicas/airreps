## FAQ

::: details Will I get a good quality unit?
It is not possible to guarantee the quality of a unit, as it can vary even among units from the same seller. However, the sellers mentioned in the original text are generally known for offering good quality products.
:::

::: details How do I contact sellers?
To contact sellers, you can join the AirReps Discord: https://airreps.link/discord and obtain their WhatsApp numbers, as they are not publicly available. Alternatively, you can use AliExpress to message them by clicking "Contact Supplier".
:::

::: details Which is the best vendor?
The best vendor cannot be definitively determined as it varies based on your needs and the platform you choose to purchase from. Vendors typically offer similar products, for example, the 'Pro 2 V5.2 TB' from Jenny is identical to the one from HiCity. However, differences arise in aspects such as support, shipping times, and the platforms through which the purchases are made.
:::

::: details I ordered x days ago and my package hasn't arrived yet. What should I do?
Shipping from China can sometimes take a while. Tracking information may disappear once the package leaves China, and will only be updated once it reaches customs in your country. If it has been a long time and there is still no tracking information available, you should contact your seller for an update.
:::

::: details My tracking information is in Chinese. What should I do?
If you have tracking information that is in Chinese, you can copy the tracking number and paste it into the website 17Track: https://www.17track.net/. This will allow you to see updates in English. Alternatively, you can open the tracking updates on a computer and paste them into Google Translate to see them in a different language.
:::

::: details My card is not working. What should I do?
If your card is not working, you should contact the seller and ask if they will accept a different form of payment. Keep in mind that some alternative payment methods, such as Wise, do not offer buyer protection. If the seller is unable to accept a different form of payment, you can try using a different card or purchasing from a different seller.
:::

::: tip
Some websites or Alibaba links providing credit card payments may have discrete website branding, look after the version number you want. You can safely ignore the images of generic products. This is done in order to comply with the copyright policies some credit card payment gateways may have.
